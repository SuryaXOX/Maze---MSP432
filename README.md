#################### Embedded Systems Project - Maze ####################

â€“ A fully functional maze course game that involves use of the LCD, accelerometer, Ambient Light sensor, Buzzer, and FreeRTOS tasks.

Your goal is to maneuver the red circle through the maze course. You can maneuver the circle by tilting the board in the direction you want the circle to move. This functionality is accomplished with the help of an accelerometer that records your board's tilt. There's A2D conversions going on continuously to record extremely accurate values. The Light Sensor gives a bright red and green light that guides you through the course. You hit any wall, you lose a life and you're back to the start.  

You got 3 lives to complete the course.
Good Luck!!
